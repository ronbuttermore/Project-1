# Brewery Finder

## Description

This web application, Brewery Finder, was developed to help anyone find breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops in their nearby areas. The motivation behind this project was to create a simple way for a user to locate a brewery and get directions in the same webpage application. Through third party API sources, Open Brewery DP and TomTom, the webpage was able to have the source information needed for functionality. With this web application, a user only has to go to one webpage to find the breweries in their area as well as the directions to that brewery instead of using multiple applications to find their desired destination and how to get there.

[Here is a link to the webpage](https://ronbuttermore.github.io/brewery-finder/).

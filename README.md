# Brewery Finder

## Description

This web application, Brewery Finder, was developed to help anyone find breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops in their nearby areas. The motivation behind this project was to create a simple way for a user to locate a brewery and get directions in the same webpage application. Through third party API sources, Open Brewery DP and TomTom, the webpage was able to have the source information needed for functionality. With this web application, a user only has to go to one webpage to find the breweries in their area as well as the directions to that brewery instead of using multiple applications to find their desired destination and how to get there.

[Here is a link to the webpage](https://).

The usage of the main page is equally simple to the design. Input the postal code or city of the searchable location. If the location inputted doesn’t match any in the Open Brewery DB, a dismissable alert will pop up requesting a new input.

### Search Result Page Usage

To use the search results page, simply scroll through the options provided. There are two buttons for each search result that allow the user to either learn more about the brewery or to get directions to that brewery.

### Brewery Information Page Usage
